# instructions for the usage of my reminding program
## you can add activities and remove them, and they will show up in a notif every n seconds, those being set by you in the beginning
## the purpose is that when you use your laptop you become aware every once in a while and start to think about stopping procrastinating
## usage - open cmd prompt and use those commands:
### sudo apt-get install pip
### pip install plyer
### pip install datetime
## install python from microsoft store-any version should be ok
## IMPORTANT! only run the script when you are in the reminder_app directory!
## more about the program
### do not put strings better than 125 chars on a csv file row!!!
### if you mistakenly added something wrong you can either remove and readd or just open the csv file and change the data
### if you have x rows in the csv you need to see x+1 in the VSCode file, and the mouse cursor has to be on the x+1th one
### for kiling the process I recommend a Ctrl + break or what alternatives there are on your computer
